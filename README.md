This is done for educational purposes, so don't expect it to be all so great (or good, for that matter).
But, it does do the basic skill/trait editing, and hopefully without (m)any issues.
It supports modded traits as well, and you can place it in your root game folder, or copy the Mods folder to the program's location.
